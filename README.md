A NES emulator written in Rust

A significant portion of this emulator is inspired (and once and a while directly lifted) from
[Patrick Walton](https://github.com/pcwalton)'s emulator,
[sproketnes](https://github.com/pcwalton/sprocketnes). I've attempted to indicate which portion's of
my code have been directly lifted from his emulator in the code base. The rest of the information
regarding CPU instructions and memory layout has been taken from the excellent resources on the
[NesDev wiki](http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_reference_guide).

This is my first time writing a significant program in Rust and my first time writing an emulator so
please don't use this code as a reference on how to write an NES emulator.
